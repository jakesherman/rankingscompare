# ordinary

Measures of association/correlation/similarity for ordinal/rank variables. In determining the association (correlation) or similarity bewteen two random variables, the variables will be treated as ordinal, so only their rank-order will be examined. The following measures are *non-parametric*. 

```python
import ordinary as or
```

### Properties of measures

* What is being measured? Association/correlation, or (dis)similarity? Correlation belongs to the domain [-1, 1], whereas (dis)simlarity belongs to the domain [0, 1].
* Does the measure natively handle ties? Some measure implicitly consider ties, others do not.
* Are the input variables conjoint, or paired? Classical statistics most often considers conjoint variables, which are often represented in a table. For conjoint data, each item has a value for both variables. In non-conjoint data, variable 1 may have items that variable 2 does not have, and vice versa. Comparing search engine results is a problem where the data often is non-conjoint, as some websites returned by one search engine may not be returned by another.
* Is the measure top-weighted? Top-weighted measures give more weight to discrepencies in the higher (1, 2, 3, ...) rank than the lower ranks (100, 99, 98, ...).
